# Stitch the PromptSpend promo from its sources:
#
#   [ AI hero shot + lower-third title ] -> [ real-UI core ] -> [ AI end card + logo ]
#
# The bookends are generative-video clips (abstract light and haze - what those
# models do well, and where they cannot garble a price). The core is
# tools/make-promo.py output: real screenshots of the built site, captured by
# tools/capture-ui.ts, carrying real numbers from the committed catalog.
#
# Audio is staged in two parts:
#   * The opening plays the hero clip's OWN native audio, alone - no music over it.
#   * The music bed starts as the opening crossfades into the story and carries
#     the rest of the piece.
# The bed runs through loudnorm and dynaudnorm because generated music tends to
# ramp or dip mid-track; normalising guarantees a steady level rather than a bed
# that appears to "kick in" halfway through.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/stitch-promo.sh HERO.mp4 CORE.mp4 ENDCARD.mp4 OVERLAY.png LOGO.png BED.mp3 OUT.mp4

# cropped to match instead (820 * 16/9 = 1458, centred) and the result scaled
# up. The content is an abstract glow, so a centre crop costs nothing.
